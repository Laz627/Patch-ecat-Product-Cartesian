This tool helps you pair data from two spreadsheets and export the results into a multi-tab Excel file.

**Instructions:**
1.  Upload the 'Items' spreadsheet containing `Item #`, `Model`, `Region`, and `VBU`.
2.  Upload the 'Regions' spreadsheet containing the region patch codes.
3.  The tool will generate all possible pairings.
4.  Click the 'Download Paired Data' button to get your formatted Excel file.
