This tool intelligently pairs items with their regional patch codes and exports the results.

**Instructions:**
1.  Upload the 'Items' spreadsheet containing `Item #`, `Model`, `VBU`, and `Region`.
2.  Upload the 'Region Patches' spreadsheet where columns are the region names (e.g., "East", "West").
3.  The tool will match items to the patch codes based on their assigned region.
4.  Click the 'Download Paired Data' button to get your formatted Excel file.
